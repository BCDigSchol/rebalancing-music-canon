## About this Project
This project seeks to decenter the musical canon and make data-driven music scholarship more diverse and inclusive. It is also an act of recovery, which has been long overdue in the study of music. This work will provide a dataset of compositions spanning a large historical period by an un(der)-represented group (primarily women and people of color) that has generally been left out of (big) data driven scholarship work. As part of this project we aim to make these data open and accessible, and share the a documented workflow that will make it easier and more likely for scholars, library professionals, and students to reuse music data by un(der)-represented composers for research and pedagogical uses, including computational work. 


### Process 
The data from these music scores in PDF format will be extracted using optical music recognition (OMR) and notation software and transformed into symbolic music notation (encoded data) as MusicXML and MEI XML. An MEI template and files will be created according to the MEI guidelines. These data will be made available for download in this repository and can be used for research and pedagogical purposes by a diverse audience, which  may include musicians, teachers (K-12+), students, library/archives professionals, and university faculty.

### Resources
There are a number of resources available online that can be used to identify additional works for encoding. 
- [Afrocentric Voices in “Classical” Music](http://afrovoices.com/collections/)
- [Composer Diversity Database](https://composerdiversity.com)
- [Music by Black Composers](http://afrovoices.com/collections/)

#### Contribute
If you would like to suggest a composition to include in this repository or a resource that curates names and music by un(der)-represented people, please visit [link tbd] and submit your suggestion.

You can also contribute by cleaning up the extracted PDF files or encoding the data so that it can be made available in MEI XML format.
