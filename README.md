## About
The impetus for the creation of a music data repository focused on works by un(der)-represented people is to decenter the musical canon and make data-driven music scholarship more diverse and inclusive. In particular, this repository will contain a dataset of compositions spanning a large historical period by an un(der)-represented group (primarily women and people of color) that has generally been left out of (big) data driven scholarship work. 

In addition to making the data open and accessible, we will include a documented workflow that will make it easier and more likely for scholars, library professionals, and students to understand the process of extracting and encoding music for research and pedagogical uses, including computational work. In this sense, we envision this repository serving as a companion to other projects, in particular:
- [Afrocentric Voices in “Classical” Music](http://afrovoices.com/collections/) curated by Randye Jones
- [Composer Diversity Database](https://composerdiversity.com) founded by Dr. Rob Deemer
- [Music by Black Composers](https://www.musicbyblackcomposers.org/) project of the Rachel Barton Pine Foundation 
- [Women in Music Resources](https://musictheoryexamplesbywomen.com/women-in-music-resources/) compiled by the Music Theory Examples by Women team

### Process 
Data will be extracted from music scores (PDF) using optical music recognition (OMR) tools, edited with notation software, and transformed into symbolic music notation (encoded data) in MusicXML and MEI XML formats. An MEI template and files will be created according to the MEI guidelines. Our data will be organized into three buckets: Extracted Data, Corrected Data, Encoded Data.

#### How Can You Contribute
- Clean up and correct the data extracted from PDF files
- Encode data in MEI XML format
- Provide suggestions for compositions to add to corpus 2
