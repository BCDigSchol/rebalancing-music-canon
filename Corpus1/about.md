## About Corpus 1
We are beginning with a small corpus (about 178 pieces) shared by the [Music Theory Examples by Women (MTEW) project](https://musictheoryexamplesbywomen.com/). Their work includes the compilation of excerpts and complete musical compositions by women composers, including women of color. It is used by music theory, history, and performance faculty, and students, as well as secondary music teachers. MTEW has a diverse corpus of music by women from which we can draw, and the data we extract and encode will be made available via their project for greater visibility and reuse.

The list of compositions and composers that will be encoded is drawn from the MTEW project can be viewed in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z9dzcnmz6S_bHAwdTHTnPlaDxmvbVXNBCqfpHvhmcWU/edit?usp=sharing).

### Acknowledgements
Ben Parsell and Molly Murdock of the Music Theory Examples by Women project were kind enough to share the music score PDFs that make up this initial corpus.
