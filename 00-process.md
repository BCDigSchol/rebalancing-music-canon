Data will be extracted from music scores (PDF) using optical music recognition (OMR) tools, it will be edited with notation software, and transformed into symbolic music notation (encoded data) in MusicXML and MEI XML formats. An MEI template and files will be created according to the MEI guidelines. Within each corpus, our data will be organized into three buckets: Extracted Data, Corrected Data, Encoded Data.
